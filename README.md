## Project Overview  
This project simulates a **real-world data engineering scenario**, enabling efficient **data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization** within a cloud-based ecosystem. The solution is designed to support incremental data ingestion, optimize data transformation through **Delta Lake**, and provide structured data models for downstream analytics.  

### Key Features  
- **Automated and Scalable Data Processing** – Utilizes Azure Data Factory and Databricks Auto Loader.  
- **Optimized Data Storage and Governance** – Implements Delta Live Tables and Azure Data Lake Gen2.  
- **Star Schema Modeling** – Structured for high-performance querying and analytics.  
- **Integration with Business Intelligence Tools** – Enables data-driven decision-making via Power BI and Synapse Analytics.
